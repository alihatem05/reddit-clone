    title: "AITAH for telling my son’s pregnant girlfriend’s mom that I will give up her baby if their daughter does not herself?",
    description: "My 16-year-old son recently told my husband and me that his girlfriend is pregnant, even though they were using condoms. When she came over to talk, she was terrified and admitted that she has a 4.0 GPA, big academic goals, and feels a baby would ruin her future. I told her to think about her own life and not make a decision for anyone else, and I suggested she consider adoption or abortion. I even offered to cover the cost if she chose an abortion. She agreed to talk to her parents, but later her mom called me, yelling that I was encouraging her daughter to “kill” their grandchild. I defended my perspective and, out of frustration, said that if she forced her daughter to keep the baby, I’d drop it off at a fire station myself. Now my husband thinks we shouldn’t have gotten so involved, and I’m wondering if I crossed a line—especially in how I handled the call with her mother.",
